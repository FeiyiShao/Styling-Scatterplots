# Introduction

A scatterplot is a useful and straightforward way to visualize the relationship between two variables,eventually revealing a correlation. It is often used to make initial diagnoses before any other statistical analyses are conducted.This tutorial will not only teach you how to make scatterplots, but also explore the ways to help you design your own styling scatterplots.


# Implementations

## R

For this R demonstration, we will introduce how to use **ggplot2** package to create nice scatterplots. 

* Before we create the scatterplots, we need to make sure that we install and library all the packages we need.
Using the function `p_load` in the **pacman** package is able to allow us to install and library all the packages we need at once time. 

```{r,message=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(ggplot2,viridis,dplyr, RColorBrewer,tidyverse,ggthemes,ggpubr)
```

* We will use a dataset that already exists in R. Therefore, you don't need to load any new data into your R global environment. The dataset that we are going to use is called `iris`. The `iris` dataset contains four measurements in centimeters for 150 flowers representing 3 species of iris. The 3 species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. If you want to know more about the `iris` dataset, check `?iris` or see [Kaggle: Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset).

### Step 1: Basic Scatterplot

Let's start with the basic scatterplot. Say we want to check the relationship between Sepal width and Sepal length of the iris species. There are a few steps to construct a scatterplot:

* Step1: specify the dataset that we want to visualize
* Step2: tell which variable to show on x and y axis 
* Step3: add a `geom_point()` in order to show the points

If you have questions about what `ggplot` and `aes` do, check [Here](https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/bar_graphs.html) for more help.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, aes(
  ## Put Sepal.Length on the x-axis, Sepal.Width on the y-axis
  x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width))+
  ## Make it a scatterplot with geom_point()
  geom_point()
```

### Step 2: Map a variable to marker feature

One of the most powerful and magic abilities of the *ggplot2* package is to map a variable to marker features. 

#### <span style="color:orange"> **Color** </span>

  * For example, if we want to the marker `color` depends on the variable `Species` in the `iris` dataset, we can do the following:

```{r}
## First, we need to make sure that 'Species' is a factor variable 
## class(iris$Species)

## Since 'Species' is already a factor variable, we do not need to do conversion 
## However, in case 'Species' is not a factor variable, we can solve this question using as.factor() function, like below
## iris$Species <- as.factor(iris$Species)

## Then, we are ready to plot 
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                        ## distinguish the species by color
                        color=Species))+
  geom_point()
```

  * ##### *Note*

    * If you do not like the default colors in the ggplot2, there are a couple of ways to change that.The **RColorBrewer**package will definitely help. If you want to know more about **RColorBrewer** package,see [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html). Additionally,the **viridis** package is also very helpful to change the default colors. For more information of the **viridis** package, check [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html).
    * If you do not like all the options that the  **RColorBrewer** and **viridis** packages provide, see [here](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-colors-how-to-change-colors-automatically-and-manually) to work with color in the **ggplot2** package.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  ## Where RColorBrewer package comes in
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") ## There are more options available for palette

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  ## Where viridis package comes in
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = "D")  ## There are more options to choose
```



#### <span style="color:orange"> **Transparency** </span>

  * We can always distinguish the `Species` by `transparency`. 

```{r,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 ## Where transparency comes in
                 alpha=Species)) + 
    geom_point(size =4, color="seagreen") 
```



#### <span style="color:orange"> **Shape** </span>

  * `Shape` is also a common way to help us to see relationship between two variables within different groups.
  * Additionally, you can always change the shape of the points. Check [here](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/ggplot-point-shapes-best-tips/) for more ideas. 

  
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 ## Where shape comes in
                 shape=Species)) + 
    geom_point(size = 4,color="orange") 
```



#### <span style="color:orange"> **Size** </span>

  * Furthermore, `size` is a great option that we can take a look at as well. 
  * However, note that `size` will work better with continuous variables.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 ## Where size comes in 
                 size=Species)) + 
    geom_point(shape = 18, color = "#FC4E07") 
```



#### <span style="color:orange"> **Put all the options together** </span>

  * Of course, we can always mix `color`,`transparency`,`shape` and `size` together to get prettier plot.
  * Personally, mixing more than two can make your graph a little bit messy, choosing to mix two seems to be a nice choice. However, do whatever you perfer to be your style!!!
  
```{r}
## Here, what I choose to do is to mix color and shape. 
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 col=Species,
                 shape=Species)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(3, 10, 16))+
  ## Using viridis package here
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = "D") 
```



### Step 3: Find the comfortable themes

The next step that we can do is to figure out what the most fittable themes to match all the hard work we have done above. 

#### <span style="color:orange"> **Themes from `ggplot2` package** </span>
  
  * In fact, ``ggplot2` package has many cool themes available alreay such as `theme_classic()`, `theme_minimal()` and `theme_bw()`. Another famous theme is the dark theme: `theme_dark()`. Let's check out some of them. 
  
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 col=Species,
                 shape=Species)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = "D") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
```


#### <span style="color:orange"> **Themes from `ggpthemes` package** </span>

  * `ggthemes` package is also worth to check out for working any plots (maps,time-series data, and any other plots) that you are working on. `theme_gdocs()`, `theme_tufte()`, and `theme_calc()` all work very well. See [here](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) to get more cool themes. 

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 col=Species,
                 shape=Species)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = "D") +
  ## Using the theme_tufte()
  theme_tufte()
```



#### <span style="color:orange"> **Create by your own** </span>

  * If you do not themes that `ggplot2` and `ggthemes` packages have, don't worry. You can always create your own style for your themes. Check [here] (https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/ggplot-themes-gallery/) to desgin your own unique style.

### Step 4: Playing with labs

It is time to label all the useful information to make the plot be clear to your audiences. 

#### <span style="color:orange"> **Basic Labelling** </span>

  * Both `labs()` and `ggtitle()` are great tools to deal with labelling information. In the following code, we provide the example how to use `labs()` to label the all the things that we need. Take a look [here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/289-control-ggplot2-title.html) if you want to learn how to use `ggtitle()`.
  

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 col=Species,
                 shape=Species)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = "D") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)+
  ## Where the labelling comes in 
  labs(
    ## Tell people what x and y variables are
    x="Sepal Length",
    y="Speal Width",
    ## Title of the plot
    title = "Sepal length vs. Sepal width",
    subtitle = " plot within different Iris Species"
  )
```


#### <span style="color:orange"> **Postion and Appearance** </span>

  * After the basic labelling, we want to make them nicer by playing around the postion and appearance (text size, color and faces).
  
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 col=Species,
                 shape=Species)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = "D") +
  labs(
    x="Sepal Length",
    y="Speal Width",
    title = "Sepal length vs. Sepal width",
    subtitle = "plot within different Iris Species"
  )+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  ## Change the title and subtitle position to the center 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  ## Change the appearance of the title and subtitle
  theme (plot.title = element_text(color = "black", size = 14, face = "bold"),
         plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "grey40",size = 10, face = 'italic')
         )
```

### Step 5: See some patterns

After done with step 4, you should end with a very neat and unquie plot. Let's end up with this tutorial by checking whether there are some specific patterns in our dataset. 

#### <span style="color:orange"> **Linear Trend** </span>

  * According to the plot, it seems like there exists a linear relationship betwee sepal length and sepal width. Thus, let's add a linear trend to our scattplot to help readers see the pattern more directly using `geom_smooth()`. 
  
```{r,message=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 col=Species,
                 shape=Species)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = "D") +
  labs(
    x="Sepal Length",
    y="Speal Width",
    title = "Sepal length vs. Sepal width",
    subtitle = "plot within different Iris Species"
  )+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  theme (plot.title = element_text(color = "black", size = 14, face = "bold"),
         plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "grey40",size = 10, face = 'italic')) +
  ## Where linear trend + confidence interval come in
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se=FALSE)
```


#### <span style="color:orange"> **Other Trends** </span>

* There are many trends that your data can be suggested.Note that the `method` argument in `geom_smooth()` allows to apply different smoothing method like glm, loess and more. See the [doc](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html) for more.

  * For example, if we want to specify the best trends by the given data, we can leave the `method` argument empty. 
```{r,message=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, 
                 col=Species,
                 shape=Species)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = "D") +
  labs(
    x="Sepal Length",
    y="Speal Width",
    title = "Sepal length vs. Sepal width",
    subtitle = "plot within different Iris Species"
  )+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  theme (plot.title = element_text(color = "black", size = 14, face = "bold"),
         plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "grey40",size = 10, face = 'italic')) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```

  
## Keep in Mind


- **REMEMBER** always clean your dataset before you try to make scatterplots since in the real world, the dataset is always messier than the `iris` dataset. 
- Scatterplots may not work well if the variables that you are interested in are discrete, or if there are a large number of data points.
- **Be more careful** if you have **Date** (which is time-series data) as your x-variable, **Date** can be very tricky in many ways.
- **Google** and `help` function are always your good friends if you have problems on your codes. 

## Also Consider

- Formatting graph legends is important for styling scatterplots. So check [here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/239-custom-layout-legend-ggplot2.html) if you want to work with graph legends. 
- If you have one of your variables is discrete, instead of scatterplots, you may want to check how to make bar graphs [here](https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/bar_graphs.html).
- If you are working with time series visualization with `ggplot2` package, see [here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/279-plotting-time-series-with-ggplot2.html) for more help.
